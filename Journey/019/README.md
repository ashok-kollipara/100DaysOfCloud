# Day-19 : Theory Day - Step Functions, State Machines and I/O processing

## Cloud Research

Spent time on going through state machines and step functions as the course I was following was not so pressed on this topic and it really interested me especially the visual workflow

- [Documentation Link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/how-step-functions-works.html)

- Read about the below topics
    - How Step function works
    - Types of states
    - Amazon state language for declaration and data manipulation
    - What are I/O filtering methods availble in between states
        - Paramters
        - InputPath
        - ResultPath
        - Output Path
        - Context Object with environment status details
    - Error Handling
        - Error (retries, backoff, decision making) 
        - Catch

## Next Steps

- Try to implement a entire workflow from scratch using Amazon State language for better hands on and understanding of the features available.
